# About me

I am a program manager turned research and data analyst. I am passionate about turning raw data into captivating visual narratives that simplify complexity, engage stakeholders, and drive strategic decision-making. I translate data into action, specializing in designing stunning data visualizations, uncovering hidden insights, and telling stories that inspire action and deliver measurable business impact. I create intuitive, visually compelling dashboards and stories that make data accessible and persuasive for technical and non-technical audiences. My expertise in data visualization transforms numbers into powerful, easy-to-understand stories that resonate with decision-makers and spark change. I am looking for data analysis mentorship to increase my skillsets in solving real world challenges with Global organisations.
